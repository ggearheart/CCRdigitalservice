This project aims to standardize the data collection (anf thereby the reporting out of this information) for Consumer Confidence Reports (CCRs), which are required for both large and small public water systems in CA.

The project will not aim to CHANGE the reporting requirements specified in the regulations but to first build a common data model for this data, then a schema and standards to help build a digital service.  In addition to establishing a common data format this project may be able to improve the data quality and collection process.
